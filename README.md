# Deep_Learning_Face_Detection

Building a model which can be used to identify the advertisements to show to the user based on his face data. The main objective is to show the ads for the events or related products from the data acquired by identifying the users face from the images/videos across the platforms. 



The initial testing model was build using tensorflow, and made to run on android platform, so that it can work locally on the device and make decisions without any consent from the server.



Future Work:

Deep dive into collaborating with Eventers company use case and make the model robust and working across different devices like Android, iOS and Web. Also to look more into Tensorflow Lite and its implementation on mobile devices.
